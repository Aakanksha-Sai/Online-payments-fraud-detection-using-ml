Importing Libraries and Loading Data

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries:

pandas (as pd) for data manipulation and analysis
numpy (as np) for numerical computations
matplotlib.pyplot (as plt) for plotting
The code then loads a CSV file named credit card.csv from a local directory using 'pd.read_csv'. The file is assumed to contain data for online payments fraud detection.

Data Exploration

The code prints the first few rows of the data using 'data.head()' and displays information about the data using data.info().

Encoding Categorical Variable

The code uses 'pd.get_dummies' to one-hot encode the type column, which is a categorical variable. The drop_first=True parameter is used to avoid multicollinearity by dropping one of the dummy variables. The resulting dummy variables are stored in 'new_type'.

Concatenating Data

The code concatenates the original data with the dummy variables using 'pd.concat' along the columns (axis=1). The resulting data is stored in 'new_data'.

Splitting Data

The code drops unnecessary columns (isFraud, type, nameOrig, and nameDest) from new_data and assigns the resulting data to x. The isFraud column is assigned to y as the target variable.

Decision Tree Classifier

The code creates a Decision Tree Classifier using 'DecisionTreeClassifier' from scikit-learn. The classifier is trained on the data using dt.fit(x, y).

Plotting Decision Tree

The code uses 'plot_tree' from scikit-learn to visualize the decision tree. The filled=True parameter is used to color the nodes based on their class.

Splitting Data for Training and Testing

The code splits the data into training and testing sets using 'train_test_split' from scikit-learn, with a test size of 10%.

Making Predictions and Evaluating Model

The code makes predictions on the test data using 'dt.predict(x_test)' and stores the results in ypred.

The code then evaluates the model using various metrics from scikit-learn:

Confusion matrix using 'metrics.confusion_matrix'
Classification report using 'metrics.classification_report'
Accuracy score using 'metrics.accuracy_score'
